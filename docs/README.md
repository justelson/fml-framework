# Root Documentation Index

This folder contains repository-level documentation that was moved out of the root for cleaner project organization.

## Folders

- `docs/project/`
  - `CLEANUP-GUIDE.md`
  - `PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md`
- `docs/deployment/`
  - `DEPLOYMENT_POLICY.md`

## Notes

- Keep `README.md` in the repository root as the primary entry point.
- Add any new repository-wide `.md` docs under `docs/` instead of the root.
