# FML User Documentation

## Audience

- Secondary school students using Form 3 or Form 4 math topics.
- Teachers integrating app-based worked examples in class.
- Self-learners using formula tools to validate manual work.

## What the app does

FML provides syllabus-mapped math learning apps where each chapter includes:

- Topic-specific calculators and formula tools.
- Structured outputs that show interpreted results.
- AI assist flow for plain-language math questions.

Primary routes in deployed mode:

- `/3o/` for Form 3.
- `/4o/` for Form 4.

## Recommended onboarding

1. Open the route matching your level.
2. Start with the chapter you are currently studying in school.
3. Solve one sample manually before using the tool.
4. Compare your process with app output and identify mismatch points.
5. Write a one-line summary of method and final check.

## Core usage model

### Chapter-first mode

- Open chapter page.
- Enter known values in chapter input controls.
- Review output and interpretation.
- Repeat with changed values to build intuition.

### AI assist mode

- Ask using clear variable names and units.
- Confirm AI selected the correct chapter method.
- Validate with chapter tool where possible.

## Learning quality rules

- Treat the app as an explanation and verification system, not answer copying.
- Check signs, units, and domain restrictions for each result.
- Keep a personal error log (formula mismatch, arithmetic error, unit conversion issue).

## Accessibility and practical use

- Use desktop for longer sessions and chart-heavy topics.
- Use mobile for quick practice checks and revision.
- Dark/light mode can be switched from the portal toggle.

## Parent or teacher briefing summary

FML is designed to improve method understanding by linking formulas to computed outputs and guided explanation. It supports structured practice, quick feedback, and exam-oriented revision without replacing manual mathematical reasoning.
