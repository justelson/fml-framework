# FML Learning Workflows

## Goal

This guide provides repeatable workflows for topic learning, revision cycles, and exam preparation using FML.

## Workflow A: New topic learning (30-40 min)

1. Define one objective.
2. Read chapter topic framing quickly.
3. Solve one starter question manually.
4. Run the same scenario in app tools.
5. Compare differences and note correction.
6. Solve two variations with changed values.
7. Summarize the core rule in one sentence.

## Workflow B: Mixed revision (45-60 min)

1. Pick 3 topics from different chapters.
2. Solve one moderate question per topic manually.
3. Validate each with chapter tool or AI assist.
4. Create an error map:
   - Formula selection.
   - Substitution.
   - Arithmetic.
   - Interpretation.
5. Re-solve one failed problem with corrected method.

## Workflow C: Timed exam drill

1. Set timer (20-30 minutes).
2. Attempt selected questions without app.
3. Use app only for post-check and explanation.
4. Score yourself on:
   - Method correctness.
   - Final answer correctness.
   - Time efficiency.

## Prompt templates for AI assist

- `Solve [topic] where [given values], find [target variable], show clear steps.`
- `Check my method for [topic]. I used [formula]. Is it correct and why?`
- `Give me one similar practice question after solving this one.`

## Weekly revision pattern

- Monday-Tuesday: concept build.
- Wednesday-Thursday: mixed practice.
- Friday: timed assessment.
- Weekend: focus weak areas and reflection.

## Reflection template (copy and fill)

- Topic:
- Formula used:
- Why this formula fits:
- Mistake risk:
- Corrected insight:

## Performance tracking

Track these each week:

- Number of solved questions.
- Percentage solved without hints.
- Common error category.
- Topics needing re-study.
